## Architecture

This app follows a **scalable, layered architecture** to maintain separation of concerns and support enterprise-level complexity:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # Reusable and presentational UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/        # Feature modules (Redux slices + components)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/           # Custom hooks (e.g., useDebouncedSearch, useMovieDetails)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # Axios logic, interceptors, and API calls
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ store/           # Redux store setup and middleware
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # Shared TypeScript types and interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/          # SCSS files for global and modular styling
```

## SOLID Principles in Practice

###  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component and utility does one thing and does it well.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The system is open for extension but closed for modification ‚Äî new features can be added without altering existing code.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Small, specific TypeScript interfaces ensure clarity and prevent over-bloated contracts.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Business logic is decoupled from lower-level modules using:
- Axios interceptors for API abstraction
- Custom hooks for reusable logic encapsulation
- Environment-based injected configs

---

## Axios Interceptors

Implemented Axios interceptors to:
- Centralize request and response handling
- Provide consistent error management
- Keep API logic clean and reusable
