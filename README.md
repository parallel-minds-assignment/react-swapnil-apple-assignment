## 🧱 Architecture

This app follows a **scalable, layered architecture** to maintain separation of concerns and support enterprise-level complexity:

```
src/
├── components/      # Reusable and presentational UI components
├── features/        # Feature modules (Redux slices + components)
├── hooks/           # Custom hooks (e.g., useDebouncedSearch, useMovieDetails)
├── services/        # Axios logic, interceptors, and API calls
├── store/           # Redux store setup and middleware
├── types/           # Shared TypeScript types and interfaces
├── styles/          # SCSS files for global and modular styling
```

## 🧠 SOLID Principles in Practice

### 🔹 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component and utility does one thing and does it well.

### 🔹 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The system is open for extension but closed for modification — new features can be added without altering existing code.

### 🔹 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Abstractions and interfaces allow flexible implementations without breaking functionality.

### 🔹 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Small, specific TypeScript interfaces ensure clarity and prevent over-bloated contracts.

### 🔹 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Business logic is decoupled from lower-level modules using:
- Axios interceptors for API abstraction
- Custom hooks for reusable logic encapsulation
- Environment-based injected configs

## 🔁 Axios Interceptors

Implemented Axios interceptors to:
- Centralize request and response handling
- Provide consistent error management
- Keep API logic clean and reusable
