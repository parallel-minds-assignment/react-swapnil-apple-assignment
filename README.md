## üìê Architecture

The app follows a **scalable layered architecture**, cleanly separating concerns:

- `components/` ‚Äì Presentational & reusable UI elements
- `features/` ‚Äì Feature modules following Redux Toolkit slice pattern
- `hooks/` ‚Äì Custom hooks (e.g., `useDebouncedSearch`, `useMovieDetails`)
- `services/` ‚Äì API logic with Axios and interceptors
- `store/` ‚Äì Redux store configuration
- `types/` ‚Äì Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
- `styles/` ‚Äì SCSS modules and global styles

##  SOLID Principles Implemented

###  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component, service, and utility has a single, well-defined responsibility.

###  Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The architecture is extensible‚Äînew features or components can be added without modifying existing code.

###  Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interfaces and abstractions are used for component and service contracts, allowing interchangeable implementations.

###  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Feature-specific interfaces are used to avoid bloated contracts. Type safety and clarity are preserved using TypeScript.

###  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Core logic is decoupled from lower-level implementations using:
- Axios interceptors as abstraction for HTTP logic
- Custom hooks for encapsulating reusable logic
- Injected configuration (e.g., base URLs, API keys)

###  Axios Interceptors
- implemented Axios interceptors to manage all API requests and responses from a single place. This ensures separation of concerns and centralized error handling.
